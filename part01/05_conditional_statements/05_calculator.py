#
# Please write a program which asks the user for two numbers and an operation. If the operation is add, multiply or
# subtract, the program should calculate and print out the result of the operation with the given numbers. If the user
# types in anything else, the program should print out nothing.
#
# Some examples of expected behaviour:
# Sample output
#
# Number 1: 10
# Number 2: 17
# Operation: add
#
# 10 + 17 = 27
# Sample output
#
# Number 1: 4
# Number 2: 6
# Operation: multiply
#
# 4 * 6 = 24
# Sample output
#
# Number 1: 4
# Number 2: 6
# Operation: subtract
#
# 4 - 6 = -2
