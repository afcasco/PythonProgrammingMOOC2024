# Here is a program which should ask for three utterances and print them out, like so:
#
# The 1st part: hickory
# The 2nd part: dickory
# The 3rd part: dock
# hickory-dickory-dock!
#
# However, there is something wrong with the code below. Please fix it.

part = input("The 1st part: ")
part1 = input("The 2nd part: ")
part2 = input("The 3rd part: ")
print(part + "-" + part1 + "-" + part2 + "!")
