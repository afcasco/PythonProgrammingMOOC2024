# Please write a program which asks the user for three letters. The program should then print out whichever of
# the three letters would be in the middle if the letters were in alphabetical order.
#
# You may assume the letters will be either all uppercase, or all lowercase.
#
# Some examples of expected behaviour:
# Sample output
#
# 1st letter: x
# 2nd letter: c
# 3rd letter: p
# The letter in the middle is p
# Sample output
#
# 1st letter: C
# 2nd letter: B
# 3rd letter: A
# The letter in the middle is B
